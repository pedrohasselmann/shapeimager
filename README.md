# shapeimager
Python package for scientific FOV simulation from digital terrain models, NAIF SPICE kernels and any detector settings.

Requirements: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, SpiceyPy, matplotlib, cython

Version 0.0.1 for Python 2.7 (soon it will be converted for Python3).
The version 0.0.1 is fully operational and has been used on the analysis in the following papers:
